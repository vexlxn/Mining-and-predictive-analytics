The problem statement is to predict the plane price based on the features of the dataset. 
In this codes I use two methods to cleacn the data (handle missing data, isolation forest to remove the outliers)
Used three regression model to find which one is better for my dataset.
The codes follow th Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining.
